        <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Sergio Santiago. In August of 2020 I began to take a</p>
        <p>course of Javascript in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>. One month later I was in</p>
        <p>LOVE with programming. I currently know Python, Javascript</p>
        <p>C++, C#, VisualBasic and Java. Follow me as I tell you about my</p>
        <p>adventures as a Programmer and Kid!</p>

        <h2>My First Node.js program!</h2>
        <p>Today, March 9 of 2021, I made my first Node.js program! I once tried it BUT I gave up 
            because it was so hard.
        </p>
        <p>I also Learned a bit of PhP today! However it is a PAIN to download. So I think I will</p>
        <p>use Node.js as Server Background for this site once I learn more.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Current Projects!</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on a App called The Egyptian Code, made with Python, Which encrypts file data as</p>
        <p>to prevent hackers or snoopers from accesing them. It's pretty good so far and is right</p>
        <p>NOW being tested.</p>
        <p>However I am working on a Discord Bot that alerts you when someone opens the application,</p>
        <p>So that no matter WHERE you are you can protect your files.</p>
        <p>I am planning on selling it for $3.00. The Package will come with an EXE app and a code</p>
        <p>for downloading the discord bot. The only thing is that you have to download discord to use</p>
        <p>it.</p>
